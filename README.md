## Data Detectives ReadMe.

In this repository, we have our R Markdown script containing all of our analysis and code. The folder titled: “prop18_files/figure-latex” contains images of our graphs. Prop18.Rmd contains the entire analysis and code of the dataset. Prop18_presentation.mp4 is the file which contains the video recording of our presentation. Table01.xlsx contains an excel spreadsheet of our dataset. 

### Dataset

We utilized the 2018 election data from the United States Census Bureau. Here is the link to find the dataset: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/voting-and-registration/p20-583.html
It is called table01.xlsx in the github repository. There are about 270 data entries and 17 columns in the dataset.

Before you begin the R markdown file, make sure that your computer has downloaded RStudio and as the Excel spreadsheet downloaded. 
Make sure that the R markdown file and the Excel spreadsheet are located in the same working directory. 
Import the dataset by clicking the import dataset button on the top right corner. You should be given an option to import the Excel spreadsheet as it is in the same directory.

### Packages
Xlsx: Package for reading excel files
Maggritr, tidyverse: We used these packages to implement the %>% function. 
Ggplot: This data visualization package allowed us to make advanced plots with minimal code
Hchart: This was used for drawing a particular plot for an object of a particular class. This package assisted us with making interactive graphs. 
Corrplot: Package helped us visualize relationships in our data. 
### Running
Make sure you run each code chunk one at a time, not all at once. 
When installing hchart, you will be asked this question:
            Do you want to install from sources the package which needs compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)
Reply “no” to this question.
